# microservices
Implementation of microservices using Dockers &amp; Containers 

I have developed a swarm cluster in which customers or clients  come to swarm manager with their request to which service they wants to deploy. Like one container for WordPress and one more container as Mariadb for back end, that Mariadb container is linked to the wordpress container. And one more container for PhpMyadmin that is linked to Mariadb database, basically, it is used to access Mariadb database.

Usecase 1 : deployment of wordpress mariadb phpmyadmin
Usecase 2 : deployement of webserver ngnix
